ðŸš€ Day 1 of My Web Developer Journey

Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Brill, an IT student with a big goal:  
ðŸ”§ **To become a full-fledged web developer.**

Right now, my skills are mostly in HTML and CSSâ€”but Iâ€™m not stopping there. Iâ€™m starting this journey to:
- Level up my coding skills
- Build real-world projects
- Document everything I learn, mistakes and wins included

ðŸ›  What I worked on today:
- Revisited HTML5 structure and semantic tags
- Practiced Flexbox layouts
- Started designing my personal portfolio website (in progress!)

ðŸŽ¯ Short-term goals:
- Master HTML, CSS (deeply, including Grid & animations)
- Learn JavaScript from scratch
- Build a project that solves a real-world problem (hint: productivity ðŸ‘€)

ðŸ§  Why Iâ€™m documenting this:
- To stay consistent and accountable
- To track my progress from beginner â†’ developer
- To connect with others on the same path
